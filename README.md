# drTest

Time: 35 minutes

Your job is to create a login system using React and Redux with whatever authorization method you want - this includes stores in localstorage or redux. The user needs to sign in and sign out. The site should at least two pages where any signin/signup/createaccount page is not accessible after signed in.

Two pages are written for you already (pages/) in both react component and functional component - you can choose which one you like.

Sign In page

- redirect to main page after sign in
- at least ask for user name and password
- extra points
  - add a create account page\*
  - add extra fields (age, education)
  - security concerns

Main page
This can display login information or any other user information you wish to ask during sign up The main page should change depending on if user is logged in or not

Do not connect to database! - purely a react and redux test - account information can be stored in local storage or via any other locally accessible methods. This will test how you are able to handle changes in state and pass information across different pages.
